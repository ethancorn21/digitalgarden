# Local Coding Agent Harness - Architecture and Decisions
ai gen

The current state of the local autonomous coding agent: how it is built, why each part is the way it is, what was measured, what is being tested, and what is planned. It continues [[Local Autonomous Coding Agent Build]] (the first build session, 2026-09-25), which is now partly out of date. Internal addresses, VLAN numbers, account names and key material are left out on purpose.

This note is the reference for starting a new Claude Code chat about the agent: read it first. The hardware, model serving, network and lab-wide changelog are in [[AI Lab]].

## What changed since the first build

- GPU: RTX 4080 SUPER replaced by an RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB (a second 3090 Ti and an RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB are coming).
- Model server: llama.cpp replaced by vLLM (the HyperQwen build), about 100 tok/s instead of ~42, 150k context.
- Harness: many additions to the Pi-based loop (below). The biggest change in approach: the harness is designed around how the agent actually behaves, measured from its session logs, instead of instructions that try to make it behave.

## Architecture

| Part | What it is | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AI box | i9-14900KF, RTX 3090 Ti 24 GB, Ubuntu, headless | CPU power-limited to 125 W (RAPL PL1/PL2), GPU capped at 350 W, both applied at boot before the model server starts. Temperature log every 15 s with an automatic safety stop of the model server on sustained overheating. |
| Model | Qwen3.8-27B, 4-bit (W4A16 AutoRound) | Hybrid: most layers are linear attention (DeltaNet), 16 are full attention, so context memory grows slowly. 4-bit costs about 1.3% perplexity against 8-bit. |
| Model server | vLLM with the HyperQwen patches, in Docker, bound to localhost only | MTP speculative decoding (3 draft tokens, 69% accepted, about 3.1 tokens per step), prefix caching (94% of prompt tokens served from cache), vision enabled, 150k context, 200k tokens of context memory (KV cache) in total. |
| Harness VM | Ubuntu VM in an untrusted, isolated VLAN | Reaches the model server only through an SSH tunnel whose key can forward exactly one port. The agent's own machine: it may install packages and research the web. |
| Agent harness | Pi coding agent 0.87.1 | Extensions add the hand-over, the status footer, the thinking budget and the web tools. Thinking effort: xhigh (fixed, see decisions). |
| Loop driver | `agent-loop`, plain bash, no model | Picks tasks, launches one fresh Pi session per step, verifies done claims, archives the journal, records every session in a ledger. |
| Viewer | Pi's own terminal UI in a tmux window | Context use, speed (from the model server's metrics), iteration, task, elapsed time in the footer. |

## Design principles

1. **Design around how the agent behaves, not how we wish it behaved.** Before adding a rule, check the session logs for what the agent actually does. Measured on the hollowdeep project: every rule enforced in code held (hand-over, tool gate, archiving); every rule that existed only as prose in AGENTS.md failed (entry length limits, targeted reading, "stop after one step", archive use). Give the agent permissions and places to put things; put the constraints that matter into the harness.
2. **Supervision lives outside the model.** Loop detection, done-verification and hand-over limits are enforced by the driver and the extensions. A model that has lost track cannot be relied on to notice it.
3. **The human owns WHAT, the agent owns HOW.** Task files present when a loop starts are the human's: their acceptance boxes define done and only the human changes them. The agent may split any task into subtasks, add tasks for work it discovers (bugs, tooling, refactors, features), and propose changes to the human's criteria. This also lets it fill the gaps no prompt can cover.
4. **Claude is the architect, not the orchestrator.** Claude turns the operator's intent into design docs, seed tasks and harness rules and fixes foundational harness bugs; it does not re-plan or rewrite the agent's tasks. Monitoring reports exceptions only.
5. **Measure before and after every change.** Every session is in the ledger with the exact harness configuration it ran under, so any change can be judged on real numbers.

## The loop, session by session

1. The driver waits until the model server answers (an outage does not burn sessions), picks the next task, regenerates CODEMAP.md from the code, and records which tests are already failing when a task is first handed out.
2. A fresh Pi session starts with a one-paragraph prompt (iteration, task file, plus nudges: split a task that has taken 5+ sessions, read DECISIONS.md to the end when it is large).
3. The agent orients (memory files, task file, git log, the code it needs), does one step, runs the tests, writes its notes, commits, and stops.
4. The hand-over extension watches context use: at 120k tokens it tells the agent to hand over (only memory files, task files and git work from then on, thinking capped at 2k per turn); at 142k or after 10 more turns it ends the session. Compaction is always cancelled. Near the 150k window it counts each prompt exactly with the server's tokenizer and shrinks the requested output so no request can overflow.
5. The driver saves any uncommitted code, verifies a done claim, archives finished tasks' journal entries, audits the task queue, and writes the ledger line.

### Memory files

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `PROGRESS.md` | Snapshot of now: current task, state, exact next step (being A/B tested, see below) |
| `DECISIONS.md` | The agent's journal: choices, failed attempts and why, blockers, PITFALLs (facts that stay true). Finished tasks' entries move verbatim to `DECISIONS-archive.md`; an index lists one line per archived task |
| `CODEMAP.md` | Generated before every session from each file's header comment and exports, with line ranges for functions in big files. Architecture rules above the marker line are hand-written |
| `tasks/*.md` | The queue. Subtasks are `025a-...`, `025b-...`; a task with unfinished subtasks waits for them, then comes back for its own boxes |
| git log | What was done, one commit per step |

### Verification

- Every done claim is re-checked by the driver: all boxes ticked, and the test suite run by the driver twice (a failure that disappears on rerun is logged as flaky, not blamed on the task).
- The human's tasks need a fully green suite. The agent's own tasks may finish with tests that were already failing when the task was first handed out, never with new failures. This lets a subtask that fixes part of a sibling's broken tests be accepted.
- If the agent removes one of the human's acceptance boxes, the claim is rejected and flagged. A `## Proposed changes` section is the legitimate way to say a criterion is wrong.
- Driver notes in DECISIONS.md stay short (first 8 failing tests plus a pointer to the full list in `.agent/reports/`).
- A task still unfinished after 8 sessions is logged as STALLED (and every 4 sessions after).

### Tools the agent has

- Read, edit, write, bash (Pi built-ins).
- `web_search` (a self-hosted SearXNG on the VM) and `web_fetch` (pages turned into text; long pages come back as a verbatim extract for a question, the full text saved to a file to grep). Results are labelled untrusted.
- `sudo apt-get` only (root-equivalent on its own VM; new system packages must be recorded in the journal so the machine can be rebuilt).
- A browser screenshot tool for the game.

## Measurements that drove the decisions (hollowdeep, a browser game built by the agent)

- **Where time goes:** 98% of session wall time is the model generating; tests are 2% (median test run 1 s). 72% of generated tokens are thinking.
- **"Orientation":** about half of each session (~5 of ~9 minutes) passes before the first code edit. Reading memory files and code is cheap (served from cache); the time is one or two long planning turns in which the model drafts every edit word for word in its thinking, then writes it again as tool calls.
- **Task size was the biggest problem:** three large tasks took 26, 32 and 26 sessions with 70-80% of sessions cut off at the context limit. After the agent was allowed to split tasks, the rest of task 025 took 9 sessions instead of the 24 already spent.
- **Memory bloat:** DECISIONS.md was the largest single read (about 12.7k tokens per session, more than all source code combined) and grew past the 50 KB a single read returns, so agents missed the newest entries. Fixed by the per-task archive, the one-line index and smaller tasks.
- **Hand-over size:** median 11.4k tokens from the hand-over message to the end of the session, 90th percentile 20.4k, maximum 27.9k. That is why the hand-over now starts at 120k instead of 100k.
- **Context depth:** tool errors rise from 0.4% (first 40k) to about 3-4% (40-100k) and 6.5% beyond 100k (the last number is inflated by hand-over edits of big files).
- **Concurrency:** one agent uses about half the GPU. A second concurrent request raised combined generation from 78 to 192 tok/s in a probe. The limit is context memory (200k tokens in total), not compute.
- **Second GPU (from the HyperQwen project's own tests on two 3090s):** splitting one model across both cards speeds a single agent up only 16-35%; two separate copies give about twice the total work.
- **Agent honesty:** one rejected done claim in about 180 sessions.
- **The game after ~40 hours of agent time:** 7,368 lines of code, 12,221 lines of tests (405 tests), about 300 commits, three design versions.

## Assessment of the model (Claude's view, 2026-09-28)

A very good executor and a weak engineer-in-charge. Its code is careful and correct (clean pure modules, edge cases handled, tests for everything, honest about done). Where it falls short is judgment: tests that pin exact constants (so every design change breaks many tests), comments that narrate task history instead of intent, no instinct to refactor (a 1,400-line file grew unchallenged), big-bang migrations instead of incremental ones, and it never pushes back on a spec. Its logs show it notices problems outside its task and deliberately leaves them ("scope creep"), which is why AGENTS.md now tells it to turn such observations into new tasks. Estimated: a job it needed ~35-40 hours for would take Claude about one working day interactively; the local model does it unattended for a few dollars of electricity. Vendor benchmarks put it near Claude Opus 4.5-4.6; on a long project the gap is in judgment and efficiency, not per-edit correctness.

## Decisions (with the reason)

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 09-26 | Ledger with a harness stamp per session | Attribute every outcome to an exact configuration |
| 09-26 | Journal archive with an index; compaction always cancelled | A compacted session carried on with a blurred memory of its own work |
| 09-27 | vLLM HyperQwen over llama.cpp and NInfer | About 100 tok/s, 150k context, quality within ~1.3% of 8-bit |
| 09-27 | Agent may install packages and research the web | Its own machine in an isolated VLAN; it was already reaching the network on its own |
| 09-27 | Agile tasks (split, add, propose; human criteria fixed) | Fixed tasks locked the agent into waterfall; its own plans had nowhere to live |
| 09-27 | CODEMAP generated from the code | Agents read the detail files in only 25% of sessions but spent effort maintaining them |
| 09-28 | Hand-over at 120k instead of 100k, output clamped at the window edge | The hand-over needs ~20k at the 90th percentile; 100k wasted a third of the window |
| 09-28 | Per-task test baselines | A subtask fixing part of a sibling's broken tests was rejected for the sibling's failures |
| 09-28 | Driver waits for the model server; short driver notes; STALLED flag; `agent-report` | General robustness and a standard before/after report |
| 09-28 | "Check facts by running code instead of reasoning about them" | The model spent thousands of thinking tokens on arithmetic a one-line script answers |
| 09-28 | "Things noticed outside the task become new tasks" | Its logs show it notices problems and leaves them as "out of scope" |

**Decided against (do not re-propose):** lowering thinking effort from xhigh; lowering the 16k per-turn thinking cap (it fires in ~9% of sessions and the model recovers well); a same-model reviewer agent (it shares the model's blind spots, and done claims are already honest); RAG over the code; Codex as the harness (20k+ tokens of built-in prompt); a higher-precision quant or bigger context for their own sake; locking down the VM's internet access.

## In progress: A/B test of hand-over notes in the task file

**Question:** should hand-over notes move from the single `PROGRESS.md` snapshot into a `## Hand-over` section of the task being worked on? This is needed before two agents work on one project, and it has to be something the agent follows reliably.

**Why the change is expected to help:**
1. No merge conflicts between two agents: every session rewrites PROGRESS.md completely, so two agents on two branches would conflict on every merge; notes in each agent's own task file never collide.
2. Notes stay with the work: today a parent task's hand-over is overwritten by its subtasks' sessions; per-task notes survive until the parent comes back.
3. Less to read, a cleaner record (archived with the task), and it scales to any number of agents.

**Risk:** the agent rewrites PROGRESS.md in 94% of sessions by habit. So in the new design PROGRESS.md becomes a driver-generated overview, and a safety net moves anything the agent still writes there into the task file (each time counts as a miss).

**Part 1 (structural, no model):** simulate two agents on two branches in a scratch repository, once with today's files and once with the new design, and check which merges cleanly and whether notes are lost.

**Part 2 (model A/B):** replay task 025 from the commit right after the agent split it (subtasks 025a and 025b, then the return to the parent), on a copy of the project so the live repository is untouched, with the live loop paused and production limits.

- Arm A: today's harness. Arm B: notes in the task file's `## Hand-over` section (a subtask also reads its parent's), generated PROGRESS.md overview, safety net, matching AGENTS.md, prompt and hand-over message.
- Measured per arm: compliance (share of sessions whose notes landed in the task file without the safety net), resume quality (does the next session's first real action follow the previous "exact next step": follows / partly / ignores or redoes, graded with the arm labels removed), whether the returning parent task still has usable notes, context and time to the first edit, subtasks accepted, rejections.
- About 10 sessions per arm: enough to see a clear compliance problem or a clear difference, not small effects.

Results will be added here.

## Planned: two agents on one project (when the second 3090 Ti arrives)

- One model copy per card (ports 8080 and 8081), 4-bit, MTP, 150k window each. First a ~30 minute A/B: two separate servers with two agents, one split server with two agents, one split server with one agent.
- Each agent works in its own git worktree and branch; `main` is where finished work comes together, and each session starts by merging the latest `main`.
- One scheduler hands each task to at most one agent, and only when its dependencies are done. Subtasks get a `Depends on:` line from the agent that splits them (missing means "after the previous sibling").
- On acceptance the driver merges `main` into the branch, re-runs the tests, then merges to `main`; a conflict goes back to the same agent.
- Memory for two writers: hand-over notes in task files (if the A/B confirms), DECISIONS.md merged with git's union strategy (both sides' appended entries kept), CODEMAP and the archive regenerated after each merge.
- Parallelism depends on declared dependencies: the current human task chain (027 to 033) is strictly sequential, so seed tasks should list only real dependencies.

## Do-later list

- Kickoff flow for new projects: from a one-line idea the agent writes the design doc and proposes the task queue; the operator approves the acceptance criteria.
- Harness bake-off on replayed tasks with hidden tests: Pi vs Oh My Pi (hash-anchored edits, language-server tools), possibly others.
- `sim_view` tool: run the game simulation for N ticks from a seed and return an image (map, paths, entities), so the agent can see emergent bugs. The model has vision; the agent almost never uses it.
- Best-of-2 attempts on stuck subtasks in separate worktrees, the tests pick the winner (fits the second GPU).
- Experiment: drop old thinking from context (keep the last few turns); test parsers for jest, vitest, cargo and go when a non-JS/Python project starts.

## Operating it (commands on the harness VM)

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Start or resume the loop | `agent-loop <project dir>` in the tmux loop window |
| Stop cleanly between sessions | `touch <project>/.agent/PAUSE` (remove it before restarting) |
| See how it is doing | `agent-report <project>` (per task and per session, with the harness version) |
| New project | `newproj <name>`, add one seed task `tasks/001-<name>.md` with a goal and acceptance criteria, then `agent-loop` |
| Veto a task the agent added | Set its first line to `Status: dropped` |
| Change a criterion the agent proposed changing | Edit the task file yourself (only the human changes the human's criteria) |
| Where things are | Ledger `.agent/iterations.jsonl`, loop log `.agent/loop.log`, sessions `.agent/sessions/`, driver reports `.agent/reports/`, project template `~/.agent-kit/template` |

## Lessons added since the first write-up

1. **The agent's logs are the spec for the harness.** Every prose rule that failed and every mechanism that worked was visible in the session files before anyone argued about it.
2. **Ownership beats instructions.** Allowing the agent to split tasks fixed more than any rule about task size did.
3. **Verify remote state before reporting it.** An interrupted command had already done its work; the report said otherwise.
4. **Truncating thinking is fine as a safety net, harmful as a throttle.** A 16k cap that fires rarely is harmless; a 4k cap would break results.
5. **Hardware: the limit on parallel agents is context memory, not compute.** One agent leaves half the GPU idle.
